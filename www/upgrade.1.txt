make database changes as found in changes.txt

grant permissions using permissions.txt

eventually drop a column from change_log_details

temporarily grant these:
grant update on change_log_details to freshports@localhost;
grant insert on change_log_port to freshports@localhost;

run convert_change_log.php3 (perhaps should be a perl script?)

revoke temporary permissions

is ports.last_change_log_detail_id  still needed?
watch.php3 refers to last_change_log_detail_id 
and incorrectly reports no changes found.
last_change_log_id

changed watch.php3 sql to this:

$sql = "select ports.id, ports.name as port, ports.id as ports_id, ports.last_update as updated, " .
       "categories.name as category, categories.id as category_id, ports.version as version, ".
       "ports.committer, change_log.update_description as update_description, " .
       "ports.maintainer, ports.short_description, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(ports.date_added) as date_added, ".
       "date_format(date_added, '$FormatDate $FormatTime') as date_added_formatted, ".
       "ports.last_change_log_detail_id as last_change_log_id, " .
       "ports.package_exists, ports.extract_suffix, ports.needs_refresh, ports.homepage, ports.status " .
       "from ports, categories, watch_port, change_log, change_log_port, change_log_details ".
       "WHERE ports.system                              = 'FreeBSD' ".
       "  and ports.primary_category_id                 = categories.id " .
       "  and ports.id                                  = watch_port.port_id " .
       "  and watch_port.watch_id                       = $WatchID " .
       "  and ports.last_change_log_detail_id           = change_log_details.id " .
       "  and change_log_details.change_log_port_id     = change_log_port.id " .
       "  and change_log_port.change_log_id             = change_log.id ";

added records to change_log_port and change_log_detail with ID of zero to cater for
ports which don't have any changes recorded.

modify ports.needs_refresh to tinyint:

alter table ports add column needs_refresh_tmp tinyint;
update ports set needs_refresh_tmp = 3 where needs_refresh = "Y";
alter table ports drop column needs_refresh;
alter table ports add column needs_refresh tinyint;
update ports set needs_refresh = needs_refresh_tmp;
alter table ports drop column needs_refresh_tmp;
alter table ports modify needs_refresh tinyint unsigned not null default 0;

create new directory /usr/local/etc/freshports.new
chown dan:daemon freshports.new 

cvs co -d . freshports-log
modify log-catcher.awk and fix path.

modify outfile and infil paths in log-catcher.awk
create msgs directory according to above paths
chmod g+w msgs

in updates.pl, check paths, and change the login id accordingly
chmod o-rx updates.pl 

also note updates.pl contains:
use lib '/home/dan/walkports';
I changed the above to use lib '/usr/local/etc/freshports.test/updates';  

when renaming portschange.pm, remember to change the package name within that file.
and change references to that file from within other files (i.e. updates.pl).

also, sub CreateDailySummary($;$) {

   my $PathToUse    = "/usr/local/etc/freshports/archives";  # must NOT include a trailing /      

^^^ change above path accordingly

/usr/local/etc/freshports.changes/archives
I changed the above to /www/test.freshports.org/archives
and copied the archives directory from elsewhere.
chown dan:daemon archives

cp portschange.pm to /usr/local/etc/freshports.new



provide access to updater in the database

grant select,insert,update on ports to updater@localhost;
grant insert on change_log to updater@localhost;
grant insert on change_log to updater@localhost;
grant insert,select on change_log_port to updater@localhost;
grant insert on change_log_details to updater@localhost;
grant select on categories to updater@localhost;

allow user to connect:
grant usage on freshports.* to updater@localhost ;
