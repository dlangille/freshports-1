When adding new fields to the ports table, you need to alter these
files:

classes/ports.php
www/commit.php <== should use freshports.php to display port information
database-schema/datatype.txt <== add fields here too.
             commit_record
             freshports_commit_record
include/files.php <== this should use freshports.php too!
classes/latest_commits.php
classes/commit_record.php
database-schema/sp.txt <= all types changes above need to be updated here too.
             freshports_commit
             LatestCommitsLarge
             LatestCommitsSmall
scripts/port.pm
include/freshports_page_list_ports.php
