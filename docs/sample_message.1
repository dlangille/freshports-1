  Modified files:
    etc                  pccard_ether 
  Log:
  Add support for PC-card router configuration. (MFPAO)
  
  o Add the removable_interfaces variable for list of removable network
    interfaces (PC-card ethernet, wireless network and USB ethernet etc).
  o ifconfig_<ifn>_alias0, static_routes_<ifn>, removable_route_flush,
    /etc/start_if.<ifn> and /etc/stop_if.<ifn> are support.
  o removable_route_flush variable is set to "NO" if you want to use the
    machine as gateway using two or more removable network cards. If
    static routing is needed use static_routes_<ifn> instead of
    static_routes or defaultrouter.
  o The optional static_routes_<ifn> variable is likely static_routes.
  o /etc/start_if.<ifn> and /etc/stop_if.<ifn> are shell script to be
    specified that are called when a card is inserted or removed.
