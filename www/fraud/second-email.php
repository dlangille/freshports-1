I never said anything about linking to my site.  But that is not what 
you were doing.  You had my site content on your webserver.

I never said anything about linking to my site.  But that is not what 
you were doing.  You had my site content on your webserver.

P.S.  To be clear: I have no problems with linking to my site. But 
fundraising based upon my work is not fine.

I'm sorry for the fundraising...it was not supposed to be on the english 
version of the site since that was not yet fully developed...
on the swedish version I spent a lot more time intergrating openbsd 
ports and debian ports to and that site is a lot bigger...thats why the  
fundraising was there...


But In the next version I will make everything a lot better...

sorry for this...wasn't meant to be like this...it's not easy doing a 
site together with a friend on your spare time and get everything to 
work with directi's bad language detect script...

This is true.  But also very misleading to the reader.

You may link, but you may display my website content in a frame.  
That is displaying my material on your website.

my content.

Ok...I will just wait for my webhost abuse to look at my site without 
any content pointing to freshports.org first so that they don't close my 
account since I got a lot of other sites on the same account...

next time you might first mail the webmaster and if that don't work mail 
their abuse thats better so that missunderstandings can be solved first...

Does this mean you will continue to include my content within 
freshports.net?

Next time do not pass off the work of other as your own in order to 
raise funds.

no I will not include your content to raise funds...

As I said. If you visit freshports.net with a swedish IP you will be 
redirected using directi country detection to go to a swedish site about 
ports that have a donation frame at top... but we forgot to use directi 
for the top frame so that was always showing the same page... thats what 
was wrong.

 From now on freshports.net will not link to freshports.org in any way...

Have you refunded all funds collected during the period of the
